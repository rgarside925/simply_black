# simply_black
This package provides a GUI wrapper around the popular Black Python formatter.

So instead of a command line, the user can choose which files and/or folders
have to be formatted.

And the following options can be set in an easy way
- linelength
- target platform
- skip string normalization

Configuration (settings and selected files/folders) can be saved to a toml file, to
be used later.
